# Usage: /path/to/script/input.sh -[best/avg/worst] [SIZE]

The inputs for all the three cases are stored in:
- best.txt: for best case scenario
- avg.txt: for average case scenario
- worst.txt: for worst case scenario

## Using the python scripts to use the inputs

`./file.py < input.txt > output.csv

The python scripts will generate the csv file for evaluation/analysis of the algorithms and to ease the plotting as well.
