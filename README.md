# College
##### This repository contains all the programs/software projects for my college labs.

### 6th Semester Labs
#### Computer Networks
* Subject includes the functionality and understanding of Computer networks using network simulators.
* For this Lab, we will use ns-3, latest network simulator to study and understand the functioning of computer networks.
* All programs in this lab are written in C++ language using ns3 library to create and simulate networks for the purpose of study.

#### Operating Systems
* Understanding functioning and core concepts begind the working of linux kernel based operating system.
* Using Fedora 27 linux system.

#### Web-Engineering
* Understanding the working and concepts behind the websites. Their deployment, technologies used are also studied in this lab.
* In this lab, I will build my portfolio website that will be accessible on internet at [https://mohitbansal.github.io](https://mohitbansal.github.io)  and deployed on github static webserver.

### 5th Semester Labs
#### Java Programming
* All the programs in this lab is made solely using java.
* Levels of programs range from very basic level/syntax of programming to advance level.

#### Algorithm Design and Analysis Lab
* All the programs in this lab is made in python3 and their analysis is done later on various inputs.
* Different case of inputs are generated using bash scripts and stored in separate files.
* Program takes the input from these files and generates the output in their corresponding output file along with the time taken by that algorithm.
